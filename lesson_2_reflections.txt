What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You need to initialize a repository in order to differentiate it from a regular
directory. Git only works with repositories not regular directories. When you 
initialize a repository, you create a hidden .git directory which holds the 
metadata about the history of the directory. When you initialize a repository, 
it has no commits at that point, and any files inside are untracked. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory in that it allows you 
to store files in a directory without determining all files in that directory 
must be committed. Instead, you can manually add them to the files that should 
be stored in the repository. The staging area is different from the repository 
in that the repository holds the metadata, while the staging area only holds the
files to be committed. It has value in that you could stage a modification when
it improved your code or checkout earlier versions of your repository when it 
didn't work. Then when it all makes sense you can commit to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can use the git diff --staged command to check what the difference is 
between the latest commit and the files in the staging area. Then you can 
ensure that the changes that you decide to commit strictly correspond to one
logical change only.
