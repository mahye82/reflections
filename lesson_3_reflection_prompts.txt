When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You might want to use a remote repository when collaborating with other people 
or working on the same project from different devices. You might also want to 
publish your commits publically so strangers can pull/view/change your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manual pulls might be preferable to automatic updates because you may be working
on some feature that has led to changes to local working directory that you want
to complete (and perhaps create a branch for), before dealing with potential
issues that result from the new commits on the remote when they are pulled.
